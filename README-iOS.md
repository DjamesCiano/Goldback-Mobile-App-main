# iOS Deployment

Below is what we run to deploy to the Apple Store

## 1. Init Command

You need the following:

* App ID: 306fdefb-4233-405d-a9e1-d50c457be03b

```terminal
% eas init -id 306fdefb-4233-405d-a9e1-d50c457be03b
```

## 2. Configure your Build

Run the command below:

```terminal
% eas build:configure --platform ios
```

You'll get a response like this:

```terminal
ðŸ’¡ The following process will configure your iOS and/or Android project to be compatible with EAS Build. These changes only apply to your local project files and you can safely revert them at any time.

ðŸŽ‰ Your project is ready to build.

- Run eas build when you are ready to create your first build.
- Once the build is completed, run eas submit to upload the app to app stores.
- Learn more about other capabilities of EAS Build: https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction
```

## 3. Create Build

Run the following command:

```terminal
% eas build â€“-platform ios // This one does not work
% eas build --platform ios // This one does.  What's the difference?
```
